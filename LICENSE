he Power of the MIT License
The MIT License, which names Akshay Yashwant Bharmal as the copyright holder, grants nearly unrestricted freedom to anyone using the software. This simplicity is its greatest strength, encouraging maximum adoption and collaboration by minimizing legal hurdles.

What It Allows You to Do ü§ù

Use it: For any purpose, even commercial ones.

Modify it: Change the code however you need.

Distribute it: Share copies with others.

Sell it: You can include the code in proprietary software and sell it.

Sub-license it: Pass these permissions on to others.

The Only Two Requirements üìú
The freedom comes with only two non-negotiable conditions:

Include the Notice: You must include the original copyright notice and the full text of the license in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This ensures credit is always given to the original author.

No Liability: The core purpose of the final clause is to protect the original author (Naynish) and contributors from any legal claim. You get the software "AS IS," meaning there is no warranty for its performance, and the authors are not liable for any damages it may cause.

It's a perfect blend of generosity and self-protection for open-source development!
