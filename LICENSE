The Freedom of the MIT License
The MIT License, copyright (c) 2025 Akshay Yashwant Bharmal, is a highly permissive license that grants fundamental freedoms to anyone who obtains a copy of the software—including collaborators like Akshay Bharmal. These freedoms are nearly unrestricted: you are explicitly allowed to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and even sell the software. This maximal freedom ensures that the project can be adopted widely, used in both commercial and non-commercial settings, and integrated into other projects without complex legal overhead. The core requirement for all this freedom is simple: the original copyright notice and the full text of the permission notice must be included in any substantial portion of the code you distribute.

Warranty and Liability Disclaimer
Crucially, the MIT License includes a powerful disclaimer that protects the original authors and contributors. The software is provided "AS IS," without warranty of any kind—meaning there are no guarantees about its performance, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. Furthermore, the license explicitly states that the authors or copyright holders (Akshay and others) are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liabilities arising from the use or other dealings in the software. This clause shields the developers from legal issues while enabling you to confidently share your work under minimal legal constraint.
