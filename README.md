■■ Telco Customer Churn Analysis
This project dives into the Telco Customer Churn dataset, exploring why customers leave, what
keeps them loyal, and how business decisions can turn insights into revenue growth.
We mix data cleaning, cool visualizations, and real business insights to answer:
■ “Why do customers churn, and how can we stop it?”
■ Objectives
• ■ Find key patterns in churn behavior
• ■ Understand the effect of tenure & contracts
• ■ Study payment methods & pricing impact
• ■■ Explore services (internet, security, support) linked to churn
• ■ Give business strategies to improve retention
■ Key Insights
• ■ High Risk Early On – Customers in the first year churn the most.
• ■ Longer Contracts = Stickiness – 2-year contracts cut churn drastically.
• ■ Payment Matters – E-checks churn a lot ■■, auto-pay customers stay.
• ■ High Bills = High Churn – Especially with short contracts.
• ■■ Add-on Services Help – Security/Tech support = more loyalty.
■ Recommendations
• ■ Onboard Smartly – Retention offers for first-year customers
• ■ Contract Incentives – Discounts for long-term plans
• ■ Value Add-Ons – Bundle security/tech support for retention
• ■ Nudge to Auto-Pay – Promote secure autopayment options
• ■ Predict & Prevent – Use ML to spot at-risk customers
■■ Tech Stack
■ Python (pandas, numpy) – data wrangling
■ Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualizations
■ Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis
■ Scikit-learn (future work) – churn prediction

• ■ Simulate financial impact of churn reduction strategies
■ Final Note:
This project isn’t just about churn… it’s about turning raw data into strategy. ■
If a telecom can save just 5% of at-risk customers, the business impact is massive ■.
