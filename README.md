📞 Telco Customer Churn Analysis
This project explores the dynamics of customer churn in the telecom sector, focusing on how customer demographics, services, and billing patterns influence retention.

The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and business recommendations to help telecom providers reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.

📌 Objectives
Understand customer churn drivers in the telecom dataset.

Analyze the impact of tenure, contracts, and services on churn.

Explore pricing patterns (Monthly & Total Charges) among churned vs retained customers.

Identify high-risk customer segments for proactive retention strategies.

Provide data-driven recommendations for improving customer retention.

📊 Key Insights
Early Tenure Risk: Customers in their first year have the highest churn rate.

Contract Type Impact: Long-term contracts (1–2 years) significantly reduce churn compared to month-to-month plans.

Service Dependency: Customers without add-on services (e.g., online security, tech support) are more likely to churn.

Payment Method Influence: Customers using electronic checks churn more, while automatic payments correlate with retention.

Pricing Factor: Higher MonthlyCharges increase churn likelihood, especially when combined with shorter contracts.

🚀 Recommendations
Develop early tenure retention programs (e.g., welcome offers, loyalty discounts).

Encourage longer contracts by offering bundled discounts.

Expand value-added services to increase stickiness.

Promote secure and automated payment methods to reduce churn.

Use predictive churn modeling to flag at-risk customers and trigger retention actions.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (pandas, numpy) – Data preprocessing & analysis

Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualization & insights

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis & storytelling

Scikit-learn (optional) – For predictive churn modeling
